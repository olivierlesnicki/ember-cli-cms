# Ember-cli-cms

An ember-cli addon that offers a simple in repo CMS solution.

## Getting started

Create a directory named `cms` in the root folder of your application. Every single markdown file created in that directory will result in a new route in your ember application.

*Pro tip:* because the markdown pages get converted to `hbs` templates, you can leverage handlebar notations to render inline components and use helpers within your pages.

## Installation

* `git clone` this repository
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

## Running

* `ember server`
* Visit your app at http://localhost:4200.

## Running Tests

* `npm test` (Runs `ember try:testall` to test your addon against multiple Ember versions)
* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`

## Building

* `ember build`
